		<h1>Near Miss Design Document</h1>
		<aside>A game where collision is fatal but near misses keep you going.</aside>
		<p>
			The game uses provides a single player challenge in which the player must navigate through a minefield with limited control
			of the ship. The ship's primary means of control are through bounces off a player-controlled paddle.
		</p>

	<h2>Gameplay</h2>

				The basic layout of the game. The ball starts going rightward toward the paddle slowly. The player controls this paddle directly
				(
				<b>see The Paddle below</b>). This allows for a good angle to be planned. The clustering and layout of the mines are
				randomly determined, as is the y coordinate of the target. Note that the width of the minefield is not final or to scale
				and will likely have to be tweaked.

				Using the burners: When passing close by a mine (a near miss), one may activate the burners. These are on the top and bottom
				sides of the ship and only extend momentarily. These will destroy the mine and collect its resources. This allows

	<p>
		<figure>
			<img src="with-shield.svg" />
			<figcaption>
				Using the shield: When a mine collision appears to be unavoidable, one can activate the shield. This will protect the ship
				from any damage and will teleport it back to the starting position if it hits a mine. Just like the burners, this is
				only activated for a moment and disables activating the burners for a while.

			<figcaption>
				After using the shield and hitting a mine: The ship's position is reset, the target is downsized and moved, and the mine
				remains intact.

	</p>
	<p>
		If the player manages to hit the target, the player has cleared that stage. Otherwise, the player bounces off all walls with
		conservation of momentum.
	</p>
	<p>
		The idea is that the player is trying to clear an area in front of the target so they may hit it easily. Additionally, clearing
		more mines will increase score. However, hitting mines is obviously not desired. Teleporting away makes the game a little
		bit harder and hurts the progress you made on a certain section of the minefield. Also, it diminishes you score.
	</p>
	<p>
		The player must use skill to ensure they activate the burners only when performing a near miss and do not teleport when it
		is not necessary. Futhermore, they must know how to use the paddle well to get good routes through the minefield.
	</p>
	<h2>The Paddle</h2>
	<p>
		The paddle is magical. This is very important. Instead of conserving momentum, the paddle always launches the ship away at
		predicatable angles. The image provided from http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f17/game0-design/ shows exactly
		how the paddle will launch the ship, no matter what angle the ship comes at it.
		<figure>
			<img src="angle.png" />
			<figcaption>
				The magic paddle always launches the ship at angles like this, no matter the approach. The further from the center, the more
				obtuse the angle.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</p>
	<h2>Win/Loss Conditions</h2>
	<p>
		The ship only has a finite amount of fuel. Activating the burners or the shields drains this. Successfully burning a mine
		does collect some more fuel for the ship. Fuel also is drained overtime as the ship is moving through space (although this
		is a very small amount compared to burner/shield activation).
	</p>
	<p>
		The score of the player will be their fuel after hitting the target. If the player runs out of fuel, they lose.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think difficulty is controlled well by three fronts:
		<ul>
			<li>Number of mines</li>
			<li>Ball speed</li>
			<li>Global scaling</li>
		</ul>
		I ignore (at least for now) any mine movement because that seems very hard for the player.
	</p>
	<p>Different game modes or progressive difficulty could be constructed based on how tweaking these variables.</p>
	<h2>Controls</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Mouse Y axis: move paddle</li>
		<li>Left mouse click: activate shield</li>
		<li>Right mouse click: activate burners</li>
